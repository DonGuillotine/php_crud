# Building a CRUD with PHP and MySQL implementing Prepared Statements.

# What is CRUD
CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. CRUD operations are basic data manipulation for database. In this project we created a simple PHP application to perform all these operations on a MySQL database table at one place.

# The Landing Page
The Landing Page contains a data grid showing the records from the employees database table. It also has action icons for each record displayed in the grid, that you may choose to view its details, update it, or delete it.

There's also a create button on the top of the data grid that can be used for creating new records in the employees table.

# The Create Page
The Create Page displays the HTML form and process the submitted form data. It will also perform basic validation on user inputs before saving the data.

# The Update Page
It updates the existing records in the employees table based the id attribute of the employee.
